# Unit 2 - Software Development

A program is a set of instructions that accepts input, processes them, and produces an output, or redirects it to another program. A program may be a complete structure or it may be a part of another program, whose collection is also referred to as software. Program development is an individual activity in which a programmer writes a program or component that is used for combining with other programs.

Extension professional fellows use a systematic process called program development to plan, implement, and evaluate their programs. A computer program, as we all know, is a collection of computer characters, symbols, and instructions. A program, also known as a driver and operator for a computer system, is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to run. The program aids in the operation of the computer system in the manner that we wish.
