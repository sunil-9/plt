# Unit 2 - Software Development

A program is a set of instructions that accepts input, processes them, and produces an output, or redirects it to another program. A program may be a complete structure or it may be a part of another program, whose collection is also referred to as software. Program development is an individual activity in which a programmer writes a program or component that is used for combining with other programs.

Extension professional fellows use a systematic process called program development to plan, implement, and evaluate their programs. A computer program, as we all know, is a collection of computer characters, symbols, and instructions. A program, also known as a driver and operator for a computer system, is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to run. The program aids in the operation of the computer system in the manner that we wish.

## Decision Table

A decision table is a structured representation of decision logic, often used in software development, business analysis, and decision analysis. It provides a systematic way to represent complex decision-making processes and conditions. Decision tables are particularly useful for capturing business rules, creating test cases, and designing decision-based systems. Here are the key components and concepts related to decision tables:

### Components of a Decision Table:

1. **Conditions:**

   - Represent the factors or variables that influence the decision. Conditions are also called input conditions.

2. **Actions:**

   - Represent the outcomes or actions that result from the combinations of conditions being true or false. Actions are also called output actions.

3. **Rules:**

   - Each row in the decision table represents a rule. A rule specifies a unique combination of conditions and the corresponding actions.

4. **Condition Entries:**

   - In the table, conditions have entries that can be marked as "true," "false," or left blank (representing "don't care" or "not applicable").

5. **Action Entries:**
   - In the table, actions have entries that specify the corresponding outcomes based on the conditions being true or false.

### Symbols Used in Decision Tables:

1. **"✔" (Check):**

   - Represents that a condition is true.

2. **"✘" (Cross):**

   - Represents that a condition is false.

3. **"-" (Dash):**
   - Represents that a condition is not applicable or is not considered in a particular rule.

### Example Decision Table:

Let's consider a simple example of a decision table for determining whether to approve a loan application based on two conditions: "Credit Score" and "Annual Income."

| Credit Score | Annual Income | Approve Loan? |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------- |
| High         | High          | Yes           |
| High         | Low           | No            |
| Low          | High          | No            |
| Low          | Low           | No            |

In this example:

- "Credit Score" and "Annual Income" are the conditions.
- "Approve Loan?" is the action.
- Each row represents a rule or a combination of conditions.
- The entries in the "Approve Loan?" column specify the decision outcomes based on the conditions.

### Guidelines for Creating Decision Tables:

1. **Identify Conditions and Actions:**

   - Clearly define the conditions that influence the decision and the corresponding actions.

2. **List All Possible Combinations:**

   - Enumerate all possible combinations of conditions and their corresponding actions.

3. **Use Consistent Notation:**

   - Be consistent in using symbols or notations to represent true, false, or not applicable conditions.

4. **Keep It Simple:**

   - Avoid unnecessary complexity. Keep the decision table as simple as possible while capturing all relevant conditions.

5. **Test Coverage:**

   - Ensure that the decision table covers all possible combinations of conditions.

6. **Review and Validation:**
   - Review the decision table to validate its accuracy and completeness.

**Advantages:**

1. **Clarity:** Decision tables provide a clear and structured representation of complex decision logic, making it easy to understand.
2. **Compact Representation:** They can represent a large number of conditions and rules in a compact format.
3. **Analysis and Testing:** Valuable for analyzing decision logic and designing comprehensive test cases.

**Disadvantages:**

1. **Limited to Decision Logic:** Primarily designed for capturing decision rules, and may become complex for tasks with extensive conditions.
2. **Potential Complexity:** Decision tables can become unwieldy and complex as the number of conditions and rules increases.

## Pseudocode

Pseudocode is a high-level, informal representation of a computer program or algorithm. It uses a mixture of natural language and simple code-like constructs to outline the steps involved in solving a problem or performing a specific task. Pseudocode is not tied to a specific programming language and serves as a bridge between human understanding and actual code implementation.

   - Be explicit and avoid ambiguous statements. Ensure that each step is clearly defined.

3. **Use Standard Constructs:**

   - Utilize standard programming constructs such as loops, conditionals, and function calls.

4. **Indentation:**

   - Use indentation to indicate the structure of the code, making it easier to follow the flow of the algorithm.

5. **Avoid Language-Specific Details:**

   - Do not include language-specific syntax. Focus on the algorithm's logic rather than specific language conventions.

6. **Use Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - Choose descriptive variable names that convey the purpose of each variable in the algorithm.

### Example Pseudocode:

Here's an example of pseudocode for a simple algorithm to find the sum of the first n natural numbers:

```plaintext
Start
  Input: n
  Initialize sum to 0

  For i from 1 to n do
    sum = sum + i
  End For

  Output: sum
End
```

In this example:

- `Input` and `Output` indicate the beginning and end of the algorithm.
- `For` and `End For` represent a loop structure.
- `Initialize` is used to set the initial value of a variable.
- `sum = sum + i` is a simple assignment statement.

**Advantages:**

1. **Language Independence:** Pseudocode is not tied to a specific programming language, making it accessible and understandable across different development environments.
2. **Ease of Understanding:** Its natural language-like syntax makes it easy to understand, facilitating communication among team members and stakeholders.

| **Language Specific** | No                                                           | No                                                      | No (though may use language-like constructs)                 | No (not tied to any programming language)              |
| **Flexibility**       | Flexible and abstract                                        | Moderately flexible                                     | More structured but can be adapted for different needs       | Visual representation can be adapted for various needs |
| **Syntax Rules**      | Not bound by strict syntax rules of any programming language | Not applicable                                          | Not applicable                                               | Not applicable                                         |
| **Usage**             | Algorithm design, communication, and planning                | Capturing decision rules                                | Designing algorithms, formal representation                  | Designing processes, understanding system behavior     |
| **Variables**         | Descriptive names, not bound by specific data types          | Conditions and actions                                  | Variables are used with specific data types                  | Not applicable (represented by symbols and connectors) |
| **Conditional Logic** | Uses standard constructs like if statements                  | Central to representing conditions                      | Inherent in control structures like if statements            | Represents conditional branches and decisions          |
| **Iterations**        | Uses standard constructs like loops                          | Not applicable (decisions based on conditions)          | Utilizes loops and iterative structures                      | Represents iterative processes and loops               |
| **Symbols/Notation**  | No specific symbols, natural language constructs             | Checkmarks, crosses, dashes                             | No specific symbols, may use standard programming constructs | Symbols represent different constructs and actions     |
