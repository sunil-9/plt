- The "Check Product Availability" subprocess is further decomposed into a subprocess called "Update Product Inventory."
- The "Product Inventory" data store is introduced to represent the storage of product availability information.
- More detail is provided on how the system updates the product inventory.

### Leveling Process Summary:

1. **Identify Subprocesses:** Identify processes within the Level 0 DFD that can be decomposed into more detailed subprocesses.

2. **Create Level 1 DFD:** Decompose the main process into more detailed subprocesses in the Level 1 DFD. Each subprocess provides more detail on a specific aspect of the system.

3. **Repeat for Further Levels:** If necessary, continue the leveling process by decomposing subprocesses into more detailed subprocesses in subsequent levels (Level 2, Level 3, and so on).

4. **Labeling and Detailing:** Provide detailed labels for processes, data flows, and data stores at each level, adding more specific information to enhance clarity.

The leveling process allows for a gradual breakdown of the system into manageable components, providing a clearer understanding of how the system functions. It also helps in organizing information and facilitates effective communication among stakeholders involved in the system analysis and design process.
